                yo learning to code is hard guys. no wonder ppl go to school and get a literal degree to learn this stuff. new site is the barest of bones rn. 
                <br> however, i miss blogging. i've had a litty past few days. beautiful weather, making new friends, learning new stuff, and biking to and from school. 
                <br> soooo crazy guys.
