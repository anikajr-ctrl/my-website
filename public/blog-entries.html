                        all i want 4 christmas is to stop the brain fog and get off me iPhone!!!<br>
                        i’m currently going down a youtube rabbit hole of videos discussing how to break phone addiction by replacing it 
                        with things like a notepad, watch, alarm clock, iPod, camera, etc etc, which is v cool. in fact i’ve been down this 
                        rabbit hole a couple times already.<br>
                        i’m very loosely tossing around the idea of getting a flip phone…. the only issues i have with that are:<br>
                        - i need google maps to know bus routes lol<br>
                        - could i even still text my friends if they have iPhones? idk how that works<br>
                        - i would need to pay for another phone plan
                        <br><br>
                        obviously i would not get rid of my iPhone, as it is still useful. like  what if i’m drunk and out on the town and 
                        need a way to get home? just using my iPhone to order an uber or catch a bus is much easier and accessible in such a 
                        state. that’s the only scenario i can think of right now lol.<br>
                        i did meet this girl a few months back who did have a flip phone, and i thought that was so cool. this guy from my 
                        high school had one but at the time i thought it was dumb because he is super rich and it kinda came across like he 
                        was cosplaying being poor or something idk.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsyGSTKlw0?si=cwWGTiZ_NRn5sbNA">this</a> is a video i was watching today that i’ve seen a 
                        few times already. i like his videos and it gets me inspired.

                        merry christmas eve from a girl sick in bed, messing around on her computer.<br>
                        i had no idea what to get for my brother for christmas, but i was at the thrift a few days ago and found a deadmau5
                        t-shirt. we both used to be super big mega fans when we were kids (and still are).

                        i write to you live from my parents home.<br>
                        as of yesterday i took my last final and i am free from the shackles of academia for the next lil bit. 
                        it was actually a really good semester. yesterday evening i came home and proceeded to info dump on my 
                        parents about all the plant facts i’ve learned over the past few months. i love learning about plants and 
                        nature and all that good stuff. next year i’ll be taking some rlly cool classes like fish class, and 
                        wildlife ecology. sooooo hyped upppp!!!
                        <br><br>
                        i’m always on my phone in some way. well if not my phone, a screen of sorts is always turned on and playing 
                        some sort of content.<br>
                        this genuinely causes me extreme brain fog, like today, because the moment i don’t have to go to classes 
                        and study, i’m on the damn phone.<br>
                        like i’m on the damn phone and still doing other things (like this afternoon i was making pins!!!) but 
                        it’s like a black hole, all consuming. always there. it feels like it’s near impossible to escape.
                        i wish i was joking.<br>
                        i do get brief moments of true release, but i’m just so used to it’s presence that i’m still thinking 
                        about it when i’m not on it, which freaks me out. <br>
                        idk. i hate it. it’s not even instagram all the time, i’ll be watching a video, listening to music or 
                        something, but it’s always on and in the background.<br>
                        it doesn’t even feel good while i do it. only feels the best and fun in small increments.
                        idk i feel like i’m super hard on myself on this, but genuinely that’s what phones and screens are 
                        designed to do.<br> 
                        they literally want u to keep watching forever.<br>
                        i think to myself that people didn’t used to do this, but that’s not true because i’m sure people 
                        would listen to the radio, or have something on the tv playing in the background while they did other
                        things.<br> 
                        i guess this has more of an effect when my days aren’t structured w activities. it’s harder to have 
                        more self control that way.<br> 
                        idk. honestly i hate it XDXDXDXD HHAHHAHHA.......
                        <br><br>
                        side note tho, i found out my dad saw cocteau twins in concert once?? and mazzy star was the opener??? 
                        bruv.<br>
                        dads just drop the craziest lore ever fr. 
                        <br><br>
                        i think i’m gonna continue reading “braiding sweetgrass” for a bit and then hit the hay. 
                        finals really forced me to fix my sleep schedule, weirdly.

                        but i'm pretty darn happy. <br>

                        my mum asked me what i wanted for christmas and i sent her a link to a button maker, and she immediately 
                        ordered it and sent it to my place, so i got my christmas present like a week ago which is dope but also 
                        silly.<br>
                        hyped up for winter break. i’m free from the shackles of academia after like 3pm on december 15th. the grind
                        is getting real. i was at school from 10am-12am yesterday ahhhhhhh (yes, 14 hours).<br>
                        crazy how i’m gonna kinda miss math. my prof is so silly. i also got an 80% on my midterm LFGGGG #partyrock
                        a girl just came up to me and said she really loved my style. YAY! i’m very green today: green pants, green 
                        jacket, green scarf, green bag.
                        <br><br>
                        for christmas i may get a plant for myself, specifically, alocasia zebrina (zebra planttttt). it’s so 
                        cuteeee. i remember at my old job when i was like 16 we had one at the till and i thought it was awesome, 
                        and yesterday we had it in plant lab and i was reminded of its existence.

                        yesterday i had my second math midterm, and i think i did pretty good. don’t wanna jinx it but… that’s the
                        truth.<br>
                        this morning i dropped tor off at band practice and i made a detour to the bog to ponder in the peaceful 
                        silence. much needed after last nights events (moshing too hard in the jazz pit, and falling on my ass not
                        once, but twice). i took many a photo on my digi cam of the different mosses and plants. i told myself this
                        would count for me studying for my plant ID exam, but i don’t know how truly beneficial that was.<br>

                        i came back home and made this roasted potato and garlic soup, with homemade croutons. was pretty good, just
                        took way longer than i expected it to, and i would tweak a few things if i were to make it again.<br>
                        now it’s already dark outside, and i desperately need to finish memorizing the 54 indicator plants that i need
                        to know by thursday AHHHHHH!!!!!<br>
                        was a really good day. i’m grateful for friends, dancing, live music, and pick-me-up pizza after a successful
                        mosh. i’m happyyyy yippeeee!

                        i look in the mirror when my braids are tossed behind my shoulders, only my short hair visible, and i  see
                        my younger self staring back at me. i barely remember being her, but as i once was her, the memories creep 
                        out. <br>
                        when i catch this glimpse of recognition, i feel as though i should try and embody her, and let her come out. 
                        i wonder what she thought about? <br>
                        probably about eating feta cheese straight from the container tbh. <br>
                        i miss her.

                        do you ever go on instagram, and scroll for like 10 seconds and think “wow! i hate it here!” and yet 
                        continue to scroll? me just now, but also everyday. <br>
                        i don’t have the actual app on my phone most of the time, as i’m just logged on to my account on my 
                        laptop, which i find does help with spending less time on the app, but that hasn’t solved the issue that
                        well. comparison really is the thief of joy (or whatever they say), and it feels so lame to even feel that
                        way ugh. so then i’m like, “oh i’ll just block myself from seeing this person’s posts and stories,” but then
                        at that point i have to ask myself why i’m even following them if i feel the need to do that?? it’s not like
                        this girl i met a few times in grade 10 will be mad at me if she somehow were to notice that i didn’t follow 
                        her anymore, like be ffr. <br>
                        anyways ben just joined me at the library, so i should get off on the social media plane anyways. time to do 
                        integrals…..
                        <br><br>
                        p.s. my math prof emailed us at 4am today saying that he just posted practice problems for the upcoming midterm. 
                        like dude, thank you so much, but get some sleep!! he’s too nice for this world.

                        i love love love taking photos, and documenting memories. <br>
                        if i had no shame i would take even more photos, especially of strangers. strangers are cool and 
                        they do cool things all the time, and my soul so deeply desires to take the perfect snapshot, but 
                        i don’t usually, in fear of seeming creepy. <br>
                        i admit that i have a folder on my phone of pictures of strangers just being themselves, living their 
                        lives, whether that be two friends sitting in front of a cafe window drinking coffee, a woman analyzing 
                        a painting, a couple reading their respective books by the stream, or a child curiously inspecting the ground. 
                        there is something magical about people living their own little lives. it’s somehow comforting. honestly people
                        watching is a great pass time too. <br><br>

                        i’m very grateful for my mental health being so good atm. this time last year i had a pretty dramatic episode,
                        and it felt as though i was going crazy for a bit there. <br>
                        a pattern i’ve noticed, is that about once every year or so i go through a rough patch, but honestly, that is 
                        in no way a unique experience. <br>
                        i’d say that 90% of the time that i’m like, super good, even if nothing “amazing” is happening. you know? i just
                        feel #blessed i guess lol. i just know that for others this is really not the case, so i guess i’m just trying to 
                        say that i’m lucky to be in a good headspace most of the time. <br>
                        i say this, but watch as finals season encroaches upon me, and the mental health graph tanks. but pain is temporary,
                        enjoying silly things is 4evaaaaaaa!!

                        i keep glancing out the window as i cook dinner, thinking that surely it must be 7pm, but nope. 
                        not even technically dinner time yet. fuck november!!! i hate u bring the sun back. 
                        <br><br>
                        here is a typical morning for ani:
                        <br><br>
                        -wake up and stare at nothing for like 2 minutes to fully wake up<br>
                        -put on my big shirt to go pee<br>
                        -put on sunscreen and deodorant<br>
                        -make mint tea<br>
                        -go back up stairs with my tea and sip it as i do my makeup, get dressed, and accessorize<br> 
                        -go downstairs and make some sort of breakfast (today it was more like lunch, so i had a 
                        grilled cheese with tomato soup, some cucumber, and an orange)<br>
                        -put the dishes away and brush my teeth<br>
                        -head back upstairs to pack my bag and put on a jacket<br> 
                        -come downstairs to put my shoes on and head out the door<br>
                        -get my bike from the shed<br>
                        -bike to da bus stop and catch a ride to class<br>
                        <br><br>
                        writing this made me realize how many times i walk up and down the stairs. damn. 
                        <br><br>
                        i just finished making dinner. i think i’m gonna eat, and then head to the library to study? i 
                        really don’t want to venture out into the cold and darkness, but i’ve been super unproductive at 
                        home lately.

                        in honour of today i wanna talk about my favourite things ever that i think about at least a few 
                        times a year: ispy spooky mansion. <br>
                        does anyone know what i’m talking about? i used to play this game religiously with my friend in her 
                        basement on the wii. so many fun memories playing this. we were probably like 7-8 years old when we 
                        were playing it the most. <br>
                        this game honestly felt like a fever dream, but one day i decided to look it up and i found it. apparently 
                        it was released in 2010, and its just a game that involves looking for things and solving puzzles, with 
                        the best host ever, skelly!!! <br>
                        i would be her for halloween, but everyone would just think that i was just regular, boring skeleton.. smh. 
                        anyways, <a href="https://youtu.be/YrPY4PEuVOU?si=mBn8-y2NS5H_4x1i">here</a> is a little video of some game play, check

                        omg halloween is so so so so closeeee! which is so awesome and fun but that also means that 
                        october is almost over, and it makes me remember that it won’t be another year until i can live 
                        in october again, you know? <br>
                        i’m kinda lucky this year, considering i can fully appreciate halloweekend without worrying about how 
                        i should be studying, since my next midterm isn’t until november 14th. bro it’s for math tho, and math 
                        is getting serioussss ugh. <br>
                        today my prof was explaining integrals, and i kept thinking about how it was like watching someone 
                        explain a conspiracy theory. like yes this stuff is all true, but it’s crazy how someone figured this
                        all out. imagine being so big brained you invent integrals??? brah. <br>
                        anyways, i’m working on related rates which is HARD, so i’m gonna lock in today and tomorrow, but the 
                        rest of the weekend is kind of a write off. <br>
                        i’m excited to see tor play in they banddd w zach and others. #first show ever. gonna be crazy town. 
                        <br><br>
                        pls wish me luck w my studies…. into the trenches i go.

                        went to bed last night at 3am because we watched rocky horror picture show at the rio. first time 
                        seeing it, it was a journeyyy. i did highkey fall asleep for the last little bit. i did dress up 
                        as frank n furter, and i was getting high school bullied by tor for dressing up as them even tho 
                        I’ve never seen the movie. sue me!!! <br><br>

                        the other day i biked to my lab thru pacific spirit, and it was so beautiful and wonderful, so 
                        autumnal with all of the orange leaves. it is sick that i can actually recognize the indicator 
                        plants that i’m learning about in ecology! i feel like my babi when i can recognize things in 
                        nature… slowly becoming her hopefully. <br><br>

                        today the plan is to finally go grocery shopping because i got my car back! me and ava bussed 
                        all the way to nvan to pick it up from my parents, where we stayed for dinner, and then drove home.
                        she so kindly let me borrow her shoes for my costume too (luv u ava xo). i wanna make either my 
                        classic potato soup or tomato soup which i haven’t made this fall season yet. oh i also really wanna 
                        make jammy eggs, but more realistically i’m gonna make tor make some for me.<br><br>

                        feeling: tired.<br><br>

                        i have a plant biology midterm on friday which is so cool and fun and real and important, and i have actually been studying for it everyday 
                        since last friday, but i’m feeling burnt out by it, and i’m not quite satisfied with how much i know yet. there 
                        are one billion terms in botany to know, go figure. but it’s still a lot ok! and there’s nothing i hate more than sitting down for hours, 
                        for days in a row, just memorizing things. it drive me nuts (or should i say fruits, because erm technically nuts are a type of dry indehiscent 
                        fruit hahaahahhah. plants….)<br>
                        also, i remember when we were learning about nuts a few weeks ago, my prof mentioned how cashews come from a fruit, and i immediately was
                        transported back in time to <a href="https://youtu.be/zzKFbUxYJys?si=qTE2028m9X4wiAJV">this video.</a> does anyone else remember this? buh. <br>
                        and lowkey i be feeling so behind now that midterms are happening, because at the start of the term i was making flashcards after every class 
                        AND doing every reading AND staying on top of math practice problems, but i fear that has all slipped away. <br>
                        what am i supposed to do? stay up until 3am doing it all? frick no. <br>
                        anyways, i’m lowkey getting worked up but it’s also 10pm which means it’s nighttime, and my mummy always says to “never believe anything about 
                        your life past 9pm” and that’s something to truly live by. i know i’ll feel better after some sleep. gah. <br><br>

                        i wanna add an about me section to my magical bog, but that’s a work in progress, so for now, here are some of my current interests:<br>
                        -pins <br>
                        -wildlife (especially birds and fish, but rlly anything at all, every critter ever!)<br>
                        -yerba mate, but lately as hot tea in the mornings<br>
                        -my bike<br>
                        -how trees talk to each other thru the internet hidden in the soil (aka mycelium networks)<br>
                        -racoon tails<br><br> 

                        i wrote all of that and realize that i’m choosing the things that will sound the coolest to the person on the other side of the screen (hello you).
                        these are all true things, but let me list some more “ugly” interests:<br>
                        -figuring out wtf to eat so i’m not hungry 24/7 <br>
                        -what are some good snacks to bring to school so i’m not completely delirious during class <br>
                        -on second thought, these are more like thoughts instead of interests, lol. <br><br>

                        i’ll stop there lol. i should go to bed after i post this. the plan for tomorrow is to wake up early, study, bike to my ecology lab, bike home, maybe
                        nap, study some more, and then get in some spooky attire and go to koerners to see wishbone asf. <br><br>

                        goodnight gremlins of the night.<br><br>

                        this morning i woke up early just to finally clean my gnome home. i’ve been so very busy with studying for midterms, it’s as though the 
                        “grind never stops” or something. me when i transfer into sciences and i’m surprised that there is more studying to do Ö !! <br>
                        so i don’t have class until 12 today, which means tuesday’s i usually sleep in, but i got up at 8:30am to dust, vacuum, take out the trash, and
                        start a load of laundry. oh, and i decided it’s about time i washed my sheets, so i’m currently laying on my naked bed. 
                        dude yesterday i fully forgor my bike at school, and i’m absolutely praying she’s still there. i’ll update you guys on whether or not she was 
                        kidnapped over night. would be devastating… <br>
                        i feel as though i have so much to do, but not enough time. or, i do have enough time but i’m simply not a machine; i am in fact a sack of 
                        flesh and bones that needs her rest. <br> 
                        i think i wanna try and add a gallery section on my site, which i was planning on doing anyways, but i need many hours to be able to sit down and 
                        do so, which i don’t have the time for right now! i must study plants and calculate math equations instead. i’ll do it at some point, so keep your peepers peeled. <br> 
                        alright i must go get dressed, eat, and (hopefully) retrieve my bike before my tree lab :p <br>
                        so long and farewell.

                        yo learning to code is hard guys. no wonder ppl go to school and get a literal degree to learn this stuff. new site is the barest of bones rn. 
                        <br> however, i miss blogging. i've had a litty past few days. beautiful weather, making new friends, learning new stuff, and biking 
                        to and from school. 
                        <br> soooo crazy guys.
