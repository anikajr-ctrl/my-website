                <strong>tuesday, october 21st <br> 10:53am <br><br> </strong>

                this morning i woke up early just to finally clean my gnome home. i’ve been so very busy with studying for midterms, it’s as though the “grind never stops” or something. me when i transfer into sciences and i’m surprised that there is more studying to do Ö !! <br>
                so i don’t have class until 12 today, which means tuesday’s i usually sleep in, but i got up at 8:30 so dust, vacuum, take out the trash, and start a load of laundry. oh, and i decided it’s about time i washed my sheets, so i’m currently laying on my naked bed. 
                dude yesterday i fully forgor my bike at school, and i’m absolutely praying she’s still there. i’ll update you guys on whether or not she was kidnapped over night. would be devastating… <br>
                i feel as though i have so much to do, but not enough time. or, i do have enough time but i’m simply not a machine, and i am in fact a sack of flesh and bones that needs her rest. <br> 
                i think i wanna try and add a gallery section on my site, which i was planning on doing anyways, but i need many hours to be able to sit down and do so, which i don’t have the time for right now! i must study plants and math instead. i’ll do it at some point, keep your peepers peeled. <br> 
                alright i must go get dressed, eat, and (hopefully) retrieve my bike before tree lab :p <br>
                so long and farewell.

                yo learning to code is hard guys. no wonder ppl go to school and get a literal degree to learn this stuff. new site is the barest of bones rn. 
                <br> however, i miss blogging. i've had a litty past few days. beautiful weather, making new friends, learning new stuff, and biking to and from school. 
                <br> soooo crazy guys.
